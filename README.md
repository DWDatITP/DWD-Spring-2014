App notes
---------

This app was built with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), and relies on the following dependencies:

- Handlebars
- [Nodemon](http://nodemon.io/)


### Installing dependencies

Everything this app needs should be installable via npm:

    npm install


### Running the application

To start the app with npm/Nodemon (enabling fancy auto-reload action and all that), just run this:

    npm start

If you'd rather just run the server, you can 

    node web.js

To start the app with Nodemon by hand, do this instead:

    ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon web.js

That's it!
